                 environment.
               o Software development (details below):
                    # Automated tool for adding and removing users on an
                      NIS+/NFS environment, integrated with all the local
                      subsystems, and satisfying all the local needs
                      (programmed in Perl).
                    # Automated tool to look for security concerns in log
                      files, as well as automatically processing the
                      email received by the root account on all the
                      machines. Created a tool to debug the results and
                      send all the concerned people in a friendly and
                      brief manner the results from the security log
                      information (programmed in AWK).
                    # Tool for automatically performing configuration of
                      new clients to integrate them with the specific
                      local environment (programmed in Korn shell and
                      AWK).

                      Secure Shell (programmed in Korn shell).
                    # Tool for automatically monitoring disk space usage,
                      load average and other operating conditions on all
                      the local machines, and for producing reports when
                      certain thresholds or conditions were detected
                      (programmed in Korn shell).
