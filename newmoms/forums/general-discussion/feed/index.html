        <description><![CDATA[Hi Susana

I was so pleased to find your website it really is most helpful for mums moving to Zurich.  I am due to move to Zurich (area3) in Feb with my toddler and husband.  My husband will be working so it is great to read up about what there is to do out there.

Are there any groups that you have personally set up for mums that have moved to Zurich?]]></description>
