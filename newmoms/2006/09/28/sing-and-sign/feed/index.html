		<description>I have also attended a Sing and Sign course with my baby.  Although I liked the atmosphere of the class it was difficult for my baby to learn any of the signs when she was head down bottom up practising her crawling.  

However, I felt the lesson were designed well and this is probably due to the fact that the instructor is a mother and former school teacher.  

Worth doing one of the free trial classes.</description>
