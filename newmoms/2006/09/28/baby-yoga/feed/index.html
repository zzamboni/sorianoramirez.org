		<description>I attended the baby yoga courses for over 3 months and towards the end realised that I was only going along to chat to the other mums and not for the yoga.  My baby had lost interest between 7 and 8 months when she started to crawl.  

Would recommend for 4 - 8 month olds.</description>
