			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my baby was born, it was clear to me that giving her breast milk was the best option for her. However, after giving birth, I was diagnosed with a ligament disease, for which I need medication. Needless to say that I could not breast feed and take the medication at the same time. </p>
<p>I fully breast fed my baby for eight months and after that I could not tolerate the pain anymore. So, I decided it was time to start weaning my baby. As a new mom, it was not clear to me how to do it. My first step was to make a trip to the pharmacies and ask for some samples of the formulas that are available in Switzerland. Following, I used a baby spoon to give the sample of the first formula to my baby. As it turn out, she did not like any but the last one that I tried.</p>
<p>Once I had the formula that my baby less dislike from all, the second step was to go to the baby shops where I bought different nipples. This was the most difficult part of the weaning process, because my baby was just not interested in drinking formula from any silicon or latex material. So, the third step was to pay a visit once again to different baby shops and buy any other kind of cup. Finally, she did like the &#8220;sippycup&#8221;, a cup with a soft or hard beak from which she can drink and it has a valve to prevent the liquids from spilling. </p>
<p>Now, having the formula and the sippycup, we started to give her small quantities of formula, of course her main source of nurturing  was still the breast milk and solids. We gradually increased the frequency of offering her formula until one day she started accepting it without a problem as her main milk.</p>
<p>The whole process lasted about five weeks, and it was so gradual that by the end my milk production had also stopped. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a big baby girl, and with big I really mean BIG. So, the first two weeks, I needed to rely on formula to keep her satisfied. However, on the third week my sister visited us and gave me this homemade recipe that really helped me to increase my milk production and its quality.</p>
<p>Basics:<br />
1 Liter of milk + half a cup (separately)<br />
2 Tbsp of corn starch (You can buy it at Coop, it is world wide named as Maizena)<br />
2 Tbsp of sugar</p>
<p>Additional:<br />
Cinnamon Sticks (half a stick is normally enough)<br />
Vanilla (half a bean is normally enough)<br />
Crushed pecans, almonds or any other seeds of your preference. ( to taste)</p>
<p>Put in a pot one liter of milk on the stove in medium heat and add the additional ingredients of your choice. While it heats prepare a mixture in a cup of the sugar, corn starch and half a cup of milk. Stir until dissolved.</p>
<p>Once the milk is close to boiling, add the mixture and stir for about two minutes. Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All my female ancestors of my mother&#8217;s family where midwives. Unfortunately that long list of midwives generation ended with my mother. She and my grandmother had a midwife practice and were very popular in the neighborhood. I remember that people would approach my mother  with questions not only in her office, but also in the supermarket, school and even at the movies theatre ticket line. </p>
<p>I recall that my mother encouraged pregnant women and mothers to breast feed their babies. She was always very supportive and gave them advices on how to achieve that goal. In my family, she did assist my sister and all my sisters in law as well. At that time, I was young and naive, so I did not pay any attention to those advices; however, I do remember the importance that my mother gave to breast feeding, and the day that I held my baby for the first time, that importance became clear and I thanked my mother for that influence that she has on me.</p>
