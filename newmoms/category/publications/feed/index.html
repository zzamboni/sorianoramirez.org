			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I started this blog, I have been pondering the idea to invite other moms to share their thoughts about their life as moms or courses that have already taken and found worth to recommend.</p>
<p>I would be glad to post guest articles that carry out the following rules of the new moms blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You must be a mom</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>If you want to recommend courses</strong>, you have to have attended them in order to write a honest opinion about them. That excludes of course instructors and/or owners of the courses. By doing this, I will avoid unwanted advertisements and keep the main goal from this blog which is to share honest tips for mothers living around Zurich.</li>
<li><strong>If you want to share your personal experiences</strong>. Please add not only the negative side, but also the positive ones. For example, if you are talking about how difficult was to breast fed your baby, you might want to add<strong> how did you overcome this challenge. </strong>Writing about the positive effects will benefit other mothers that might be having the same difficulty as you did.</li>
</ul>
<p>To share your article, send me an <a href="contact/" target="_blank" title="contact/">email</a>.  I am looking forward to hear from you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you are looking for a highchair and cannot decide which one is the best for your baby, the new issue of <a href="http://www.testeo.ch" target="_blank" title="Testeo.ch">Test</a>  (a Product test source, 8/2007 edition) has results for different groups of <a href="http://www.testeo.ch/index.aspx?suche=kinderhochst%C3%BChle&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" title="Testeo.ch">highchairs</a>. The tests were based on: Design, Stability, Robustness, Safety, Easiness to handle and Toxic components of the chair.</p>
<p>The results ranged between &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;insufficient&#8221; scores. For example, in the category of multiage chairs the Stokke Tripp Trapp got the best reviews.</p>
<p>This site is worth looking at as it also includes maximum prices for the chairs.</p>

Even though, I&#8217;m still not a client of it, I know that it is the one which offers the best prices for almost any basic product in Germany and that they are expanding to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Just in case you are interested, it seems that a project of building a <a href="http://www.zsz.ch/storys/storys_laufend.cfm?vID=4879" target="_blank" title="http://www.zsz.ch/storys/storys_laufend.cfm?vID=4879">new branch in Horgen </a>is about to happen, and the plans are to have it ready by the end of next year.</p>
