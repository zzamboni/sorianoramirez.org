I have been attending the Birth Energetics class since I was 20 weeks<br />
pregnant (I am in the 32nd week now). The class is wonderful! We do<br />
a lot of stretching, breathing, back, pelvic floor and spine exercises<br />
which helps so much especially now that my belly is getting very heavy.<br />
The class also helped me to meet other English speaking, new “mom to-be”-s;<br />
in fact last week we had our first Pregy-dinner outing.<br />
Carol (the instructor) is very helpful; she provides a lot of useful<br />
information about other classes, having a baby in Switzerland and she listens<br />
to your individual needs during class.<br />
I can certainly recommend this class to everyone.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you are looking for a highchair and cannot decide which one is the best for your baby, the new issue of <a href="http://www.testeo.ch" target="_blank" title="Testeo.ch">Test</a>  (a Product test source, 8/2007 edition) has results for different groups of <a href="http://www.testeo.ch/index.aspx?suche=kinderhochst%C3%BChle&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" title="Testeo.ch">highchairs</a>. The tests were based on: Design, Stability, Robustness, Safety, Easiness to handle and Toxic components of the chair.</p>
<p>The results ranged between &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;insufficient&#8221; scores. For example, in the category of multiage chairs the Stokke Tripp Trapp got the best reviews.</p>
<p>This site is worth looking at as it also includes maximum prices for the chairs.</p>
