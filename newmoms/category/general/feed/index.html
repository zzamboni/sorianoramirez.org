			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last couple of months, I have received several emails asking me if I&#8217;m planning to write some more.</p>
<p>Of course, this blog has been a very nice way of sharing my stories about being a mom and since I gave birth to my second beautiful daughter, it has been in my to-do list to share some more stories here.</p>
<p>However, and as all mothers with two or more children will say, having a toddler and a baby is already a very hard job to do. But what exactly does HARD work mean? you might ask, so here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time that you used to have by yourself when your first baby/todller/child was sleeping during the day, might not coincide with the time that your second baby chooses to have her siesta as well. During this time, your baby might want to play, eat, burp or have colic which means that you might be busy taking care of her.</li>
<li>If your second baby cries when the first is sleeping chances are that the first one will wake up not feeling very happy about it, so you might end up trying to calm down two little people.</li>
<li>If you are breast feeding the second one, nights are not always a time to get rest but to feed the baby.</li>
<li>During the day, you better be ready because your first child has so much energy already.</li>
<li>Plus, you have to make some space in your busy schedule to have some one-on-one play time with the first one in order to avoid any jealousy towards the new baby.</li>
<li>At the end of the day, or whenever you have a few hours for yourself, you fall asleep whether you plan it or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>So then why would someone have a second baby if you have to deal with all of these issues?</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you that having a second child has been the most incredible experience not only for me but for my entire family. For instance my first daughter has learned to be patient, tolerant and to share. Being the first and only child gave her very good qualities, as she knew how important she was for us because she had all our attention. However, the arrival of her sister taught her that she had to share mom and dad not only emotionally but physically. She has learned to take turns with us and that if her sister wakes her up in the middle of the night is because she might have a need. Therefore, tolerance is now in her vocabulary. Plus she is in the age where she is learning about independence and having a little space to take her own decisions instead of having mom and dad on her back has been a very nice experience for her.</p>
<p>For my husband and myself, having a second child taught us to chill out. With the first one we were worried for just everything, with the second one, we have been actually enjoying her more knowing already what might come for example if she gets a cold, diarrhea, vomit, a colic, etc. we have learned to patiently follow the proper procedure. Not to mention me going into my second C-section which I already knew how, where and when and actually enjoyed my stay in the hospital.</p>
<p>Finally, as a family, my second child brought us more identity as a group rather than a trio. Having more things to share and hopes to fulfill in the future. Overall, I will definitely recommend it as I am happier now than I was before.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been so long since I wrote my last entry in this blog, but now I got rid of all the spiders in my virtual desk!</p>
<p>I really felt overwhelmed from the course that this blog was taking, so I forgot the fun that I used to have by writing on it. However, having taken some vacation, I am returning with more energy.</p>
<p>First of all, my idea of reviving this blog is to announce events but not for commercial purposes, so please stop sending emails to me to advertise your own business here. On the other hand, I am always open to post tips or events from mothers who find something fun or useful for children.</p>
<p>Now the &#8220;big&#8221; comeback has a literal meaning because I will be mother for a second time. At the moment, my belly is so big that it really fits with the title. Having a second baby has taught me a lot of things and clarified a lot of past experiences with my first child. So, in this blog I will write about my new perspective of things.</p>
<p>I hope we all have a good time!</p>

I have been attending the Birth Energetics class since I was 20 weeks<br />
pregnant (I am in the 32nd week now). The class is wonderful! We do<br />
a lot of stretching, breathing, back, pelvic floor and spine exercises<br />
which helps so much especially now that my belly is getting very heavy.<br />
The class also helped me to meet other English speaking, new “mom to-be”-s;<br />
in fact last week we had our first Pregy-dinner outing.<br />
Carol (the instructor) is very helpful; she provides a lot of useful<br />
information about other classes, having a baby in Switzerland and she listens<br />
to your individual needs during class.<br />
I can certainly recommend this class to everyone.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I started this blog, I have been pondering the idea to invite other moms to share their thoughts about their life as moms or courses that have already taken and found worth to recommend.</p>
<p>I would be glad to post guest articles that carry out the following rules of the new moms blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You must be a mom</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>If you want to recommend courses</strong>, you have to have attended them in order to write a honest opinion about them. That excludes of course instructors and/or owners of the courses. By doing this, I will avoid unwanted advertisements and keep the main goal from this blog which is to share honest tips for mothers living around Zurich.</li>
<li><strong>If you want to share your personal experiences</strong>. Please add not only the negative side, but also the positive ones. For example, if you are talking about how difficult was to breast fed your baby, you might want to add<strong> how did you overcome this challenge. </strong>Writing about the positive effects will benefit other mothers that might be having the same difficulty as you did.</li>
</ul>
<p>To share your article, send me an <a href="http://newmoms.ch/contact/" target="_blank" title="http://newmoms.ch/contact/">email</a>.  I am looking forward to hear from you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On my blog vacation, I have been exploring different activities that I have never done before. One of them is making crafts. Since I never considered myself as a talented crafter, I have to say that I am very proud now that I have given it a try.</p>
<p>I include one of my latest creations that we are going to use in a teddy bear contest held on my daughters play school. All I can say about making it, is that it takes a lot of time by attaching every single piece of bead of its dress. For the dress, I used one blouse of my daughters and the hair is made of wool. I got all the material in a local crafts store. I visited the main department stores (Coop, Migros) but could not find so specific materials.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>After a long vacation, I am finally here ready to post what I have learned in the past several months.</p>
<p>My first post is dedicated to one of my best friends whom happens to be also my physiotherapist. As some of you might know, I have an injured back and neck, so I have been around two and a half years now in therapy and after the birth of my daughter, the pain increased which led of the need of a Rheumathologist and a physiotherapy.</p>
<p>When I met <a href="http://www.kunzphysio.ch/content/team.htm" target="_blank" title="KunzPhysiotherapie">Cornelia Seitz</a>, my lower back was so damaged, I could not even lay down in the physiotherapy bed and standing up was really painful. But Cornelia worked it so well, helped me to get stronger muscles by giving me physical exercises and gave me so many tips to decrease the pain that now I can sit down here typing two hours in a row without any pain at all. I am so grateful.</p>
<p>Kisses to Cornelia!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are mothers not allowed to give their opinions? </p>
<p>This topic was inspired by one of our adventures on Friday. It starts when I was contacted by Gymboree, because this company found my comments about the open day at Gymboree Zug negative.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to make some remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The open day at Gymboree Zug was the only day that we had contact with it. We have not attended any trial courses before nor after it. So, what I wrote there was merely my opinion about that specific day.</li>
<li>We are attending two courses at Gymboree Zurich, and we actually love it. The two courses which are Play and Music are not only good but excellent.</li>
<li>We were interested in attending one course at Gymboree Zug as the schedule matched perfect with ours plus it is actually the nearest Gymboree franchise from our home. Therefore our interest in attending the open day.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this blog, I intend not only to announce events, but also to give my opinions about them and to open a space where all moms can express themselves. I usually write my own experiences and hope that you use it if it fits you or leave it if it does not. Moreover, I am always happy to read comments on the blog because that actually gives me some feedback. </p>
<p>I believe on freedom of speech and if Gymboree or any other service provider about whom I write disagrees with my opinions, I would encourage them to both take the honest feedback from a customer as an opportunity to improve their services, and to make their opinions public by leaving comments on the blog so everyone can benefit and know about all the sides in the discussion. </p>

A quote from Esther de Vries:&#8221;The Fair is a wonderful way of finding out all about parenting resources in the area and even beyond&#8221; . </p>
<ul>
<li>Where:  in the Kirchgemeindehaus in Kilchberg</li>
<li>When:   this Saturday, 17 March 2007</li>
<li>Time:    non specified</li>
<li>Who:     For all parents with children that would like to have fun with Face Painting, Magic Show, Story Telling, International food stalls, PC Help,  and over 60 Exhibitors. </li>
<li>Comments:   Refreshments all day and much much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE: </em></strong><em> We did attend this event and it was quite good. The entrance was free of charge and there were lots of activities for children.  There were also many information booths and very tasty international food.<br />
</em><em><br />
Overall, what we found it of most interest was the information that we got about all the DayCare institutions as well as Kindergartens as we might enroll our daughter in one of them. </p>
<p>I certainly recommend it to you in case you are interested in attending next year.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in my rebelious young years, when I remember my siblings calling me a spoiled mouse. I remember, my mother cooking for me meals without meat that I would enjoy. She would make about three to four different main courses as one of my sisters could not eat any diary products, and another brother did not tolerate tomato or battered dishes. The amazing part is that the cooking time that it took for her to cook everything is more or less the same time that it is taking me now to cook just one dish for my baby and myself.</p>
<p>Diversity is also a problem that I have been experiencing. As my baby grows, she is developing a very fine taste which lately, I find very hard to satisfy. Am I alone here? I do not know.  I wonder if my mother use to feel the same when she started to be a mom. Unfortunately, I cannot ask her as she is not longer with us.</p>
