I have been attending the Birth Energetics class since I was 20 weeks<br />
pregnant (I am in the 32nd week now). The class is wonderful! We do<br />
a lot of stretching, breathing, back, pelvic floor and spine exercises<br />
which helps so much especially now that my belly is getting very heavy.<br />
The class also helped me to meet other English speaking, new “mom to-be”-s;<br />
in fact last week we had our first Pregy-dinner outing.<br />
Carol (the instructor) is very helpful; she provides a lot of useful<br />
information about other classes, having a baby in Switzerland and she listens<br />
to your individual needs during class.<br />
I can certainly recommend this class to everyone.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On my blog vacation, I have been exploring different activities that I have never done before. One of them is making crafts. Since I never considered myself as a talented crafter, I have to say that I am very proud now that I have given it a try.</p>
<p>I include one of my latest creations that we are going to use in a teddy bear contest held on my daughters play school. All I can say about making it, is that it takes a lot of time by attaching every single piece of bead of its dress. For the dress, I used one blouse of my daughters and the hair is made of wool. I got all the material in a local crafts store. I visited the main department stores (Coop, Migros) but could not find so specific materials.</p>

We have attended Mary&#8217;s lessons. All I have to say is that she is doing a very good job, filling Jane&#8217;s shoes (Jane has years of experience on this course but she is taking a leave until September) is not an easy task. She is a very sweet woman as well.</p>

A quote from Esther de Vries:&#8221;The Fair is a wonderful way of finding out all about parenting resources in the area and even beyond&#8221; . </p>
<ul>
<li>Where:  in the Kirchgemeindehaus in Kilchberg</li>
<li>When:   this Saturday, 17 March 2007</li>
<li>Time:    non specified</li>
<li>Who:     For all parents with children that would like to have fun with Face Painting, Magic Show, Story Telling, International food stalls, PC Help,  and over 60 Exhibitors. </li>
<li>Comments:   Refreshments all day and much much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE: </em></strong><em> We did attend this event and it was quite good. The entrance was free of charge and there were lots of activities for children.  There were also many information booths and very tasty international food.<br />
</em><em><br />
Overall, what we found it of most interest was the information that we got about all the DayCare institutions as well as Kindergartens as we might enroll our daughter in one of them. </p>
<p>I certainly recommend it to you in case you are interested in attending next year.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong><em>: We did attend the open day at Gymboree located in Zug. Having already experience with Gymboree sites, we did find the open day not very enthusiastic.  We really went just to sniff because we did not feel very attracted by the way the organization was conducted. I have to give credits though to the music teacher who did her best to keep everyone focused in the class and not get distracted by the crying babies attending.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Wednesday, my baby and I were enjoying the weather by walking across town. While we were walking I spotted a building which had toys inside. I thought, it was a new toystore and went inside. What I found actually, was a Ludothek which happens to have several toys for children up to 1 year old as well as board games for adults. The Ludothek is not very fully equipped, but it is worth to check it out. </p>
<p>The Lady at the Ludothek was very friendly and helped me to find a nice toy for my baby who happens to be less than one year old. She said that the ludothek is expecting to have more toys for babies around 8 to 12 months this week.</p>
<p>For more information, you can stop by the ludothek at:</p>
<p>Altes Gewerbeschulhaus, 2. Stock, Zimmer 10, Schönenbergstrasse 4a 8820 Wädenswil</p>
