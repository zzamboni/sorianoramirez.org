I have been attending the Birth Energetics class since I was 20 weeks<br />
pregnant (I am in the 32nd week now). The class is wonderful! We do<br />
a lot of stretching, breathing, back, pelvic floor and spine exercises<br />
which helps so much especially now that my belly is getting very heavy.<br />
The class also helped me to meet other English speaking, new “mom to-be”-s;<br />
in fact last week we had our first Pregy-dinner outing.<br />
Carol (the instructor) is very helpful; she provides a lot of useful<br />
information about other classes, having a baby in Switzerland and she listens<br />
to your individual needs during class.<br />
I can certainly recommend this class to everyone.<br />
Mariann</span></p>

<p>If you are planning or are breast feeding your baby now, you may enjoy the chats from this group. From my own experience, it helped me to share ideas and sometimes issues that came along when you breast feed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Advantages:</p>
<p></span>Every time that I have attended these kind of meetings, I feel good because I can identify myself with many of the topics and problems discussed.</p>
<p>Breast feeding brings many questions for a mother, specially a new one, and this group helps you to realize that you are not the only one that has these questions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Disadvantages:</p>
<p></span>As everyone share their breast feeding experiences, you might find some mothers that have inflexible and extreme opinions about how and when to stop breast feeding. However, as one of the organizer once said, take what suits your situation and opinions and leave the rest.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muki-Treff, Mütter mit Kleinkindern</p>
<p>I was encouraged to attend to this group by one of my (few) Swiss friends who lives in Wädenswil as well. At the beginning, I was not keen to attend due to the fact that I am not very fluent in the Swiss German dialect. However, I went and found out that it is actually a very nice way to meet Swiss people.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Advantages:</p>
<p></span>As I said, it helps you to integrate more into the Swiss culture. The majority of the attending mothers appreciate the effort that you put to be willing to know more about this country, its language and people.</p>
<p>Your baby meet future playmates or classmates if you plan to stay for a long period of time within your actual living area.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Disadvantages</span>:</p>
<p>It can be quite intimidating to be the only foreign who cannot speak and understand full conversations. However, it is worth a try.</p>
