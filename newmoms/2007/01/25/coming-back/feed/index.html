		<description>Hi Niki,
As far as I&#039;m concerned, there is no such place in Zurich. However, here are some ideas: a) Call a car rental company and ask if they would rent the car seat without having to rent an auto. b) You can buy a used one in ricanrdo.ch which is the most popular site in Switzerland to buy/sell used things. c) You can post it in one of the forums here, you might find someone willing you to rent/lend one.</description>

		<description>Hi. I&#039;ve made last-minute plans to visit Zurich with my baby son next week and friends are going to be transporting us around. Is there anywhere in Zurich I can hire a baby car seat (rear-facing) without hiring a car? We&#039;ll be over there for just under a week. I already have to bring a stroller so dont think the airline will permit a car seat as well. Thanks!</description>
