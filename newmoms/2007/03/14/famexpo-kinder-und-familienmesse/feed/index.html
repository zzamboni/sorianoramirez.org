		<description>Hi there - let me pls tell something regarding the pricing: 
first - admission for children up to 18 years is even free. Where else can kids have that much fun at no cost? Pls compare to other attractions as e.g. Zoo, cinema, Indoor-playgrounds, museum, Kinderkonzerte....
then - FamExpo is not only offering many attractions as e.g. kids-concerts with Andrew Bond and karTON, a unique danceshow with Kids, Miss Schwanger-competition and more, but brings professional know-how to young families in several talks. All these informations in addition to numberless events as well as a top basic infrastructure for families are included in this one-time-fee!

In addition, pricing for food is very family-friendly. And there are several options to get a rebate (e.g. with CSS-Card, with family Card from Wir Eltern, with Carte Blanche).

I know that I may not be absolutely neutral in this as I am part of the FamExpo-Team, but if I would need to go there with my family (3 Kids, that would mean 30 Franken admission for me and my husband), I&#039;d be happy that I could spend some happy hours and have really much fun at this price (at least I do rarely get a possibility to ho somewhere without paying less than 100 CHF with my family these days...). 

And I can guarantee: FamExpo is worth every Franken you spend!!!</description>
