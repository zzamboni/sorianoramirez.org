					<p>Are mothers not allowed to give their opinions? </p>
<p>This topic was inspired by one of our adventures on Friday. It starts when I was contacted by Gymboree, because this company found my comments about the open day at Gymboree Zug negative.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to make some remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The open day at Gymboree Zug was the only day that we had contact with it. We have not attended any trial courses before nor after it. So, what I wrote there was merely my opinion about that specific day.</li>
<li>We are attending two courses at Gymboree Zurich, and we actually love it. The two courses which are Play and Music are not only good but excellent.</li>
<li>We were interested in attending one course at Gymboree Zug as the schedule matched perfect with ours plus it is actually the nearest Gymboree franchise from our home. Therefore our interest in attending the open day.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this blog, I intend not only to announce events, but also to give my opinions about them and to open a space where all moms can express themselves. I usually write my own experiences and hope that you use it if it fits you or leave it if it does not. Moreover, I am always happy to read comments on the blog because that actually gives me some feedback. </p>
<p>I believe on freedom of speech and if Gymboree or any other service provider about whom I write disagrees with my opinions, I would encourage them to both take the honest feedback from a customer as an opportunity to improve their services, and to make their opinions public by leaving comments on the blog so everyone can benefit and know about all the sides in the discussion. </p>

					<p>One of my German teachers used to talk a lot about how she missed from Germany an Aldi store. Even though, I&#8217;m still not a client of it, I know that it is the one which offers the best prices for almost any basic product in Germany and that they are expanding to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Just in case you are interested, it seems that a project of building a <a href="http://www.zsz.ch/storys/storys_laufend.cfm?vID=4879" target="_blank" title="http://www.zsz.ch/storys/storys_laufend.cfm?vID=4879">new branch in Horgen </a>is about to happen, and the plans are to have it ready by the end of next year.</p>

A quote from Esther de Vries:&#8221;The Fair is a wonderful way of finding out all about parenting resources in the area and even beyond&#8221; . </p>
<ul>
<li>Where:  in the Kirchgemeindehaus in Kilchberg</li>
<li>When:   this Saturday, 17 March 2007</li>
<li>Time:    non specified</li>
<li>Who:     For all parents with children that would like to have fun with Face Painting, Magic Show, Story Telling, International food stalls, PC Help,  and over 60 Exhibitors. </li>
<li>Comments:   Refreshments all day and much much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE: </em></strong><em> We did attend this event and it was quite good. The entrance was free of charge and there were lots of activities for children.  There were also many information booths and very tasty international food.<br />
</em><em><br />
Overall, what we found it of most interest was the information that we got about all the DayCare institutions as well as Kindergartens as we might enroll our daughter in one of them. </p>
<p>I certainly recommend it to you in case you are interested in attending next year.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://gymboree.ch/" target="_blank" title="http://gymboree.ch/">Gymboree</a> site located in Zug is having an open day for you and your baby to &#8220;sniff  in Music, Play and Arts&#8221;.</p>

<li>Where: At <a href="http://gymboree.ch/e/when_where.html" target="_blank" title="http://gymboree.ch/e/when_where.html">Gymboree Play &#38; Music  Zug</a>, Bahnhof Zug (second floor), 6300 Zug.</li>

<li>Who: For all parents with children from 0 to 5 years old.</li>
<li>Comments: Drinks and snacks will be offered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong><em>: We did attend the open day at Gymboree located in Zug. Having already experience with Gymboree sites, we did find the open day not very enthusiastic.  We really went just to sniff because we did not feel very attracted by the way the organization was conducted. I have to give credits though to the music teacher who did her best to keep everyone focused in the class and not get distracted by the crying babies attending.</em></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Back in my rebelious young years, when I remember my siblings calling me a spoiled mouse. I remember, my mother cooking for me meals without meat that I would enjoy. She would make about three to four different main courses as one of my sisters could not eat any diary products, and another brother did not tolerate tomato or battered dishes. The amazing part is that the cooking time that it took for her to cook everything is more or less the same time that it is taking me now to cook just one dish for my baby and myself.</p>
<p>Diversity is also a problem that I have been experiencing. As my baby grows, she is developing a very fine taste which lately, I find very hard to satisfy. Am I alone here? I do not know.  I wonder if my mother use to feel the same when she started to be a mom. Unfortunately, I cannot ask her as she is not longer with us.</p>

• if the baby might have Asthma<br />
• an informative article about the Pneumococcus bacteria.</p>
